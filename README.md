# ft_printf
ft_printf is reproduced C's printf function. Just like real printf, it allows the following functionality:

```
%[flags][width][.precision][length]type
```

Result is a formated string. Each of these parts is explained below.

## Getting Started

Run **make**, which results in library called libftprintf.a. In your source file, use ft_printf() function just as you would use printf(). Furthermore, compile your source code with libftprintf.a to use ft_printf() function. So libftprint.a includes the ft_printf() function.

```
gcc main.c libftprintf.a
```
## Functionality
### [flags]

Following flags are supported
```
'#'(hash) - For o, x, X types, the text 0, 0x, 0X, respectively, is prepended to non-zero numbers.
'0'(zero) - When the 'width' option is specified, prepends zeros for numeric types. (The default prepends spaces.)
For example, printf("%2X",3) produces ' 3', while printf("%04X",3) produces '0003'.
'-'(minus) - Left-align the output of this placeholder. (The default is to right-align the output.)
'+'(plus) - Prepends a plus for positive signed-numeric types.
' '(space) - Prepends a space for positive signed-numeric types.This flag is ignored if the + flag exists.
```

### [width]
Width specifies a minimum number of characters to output.
For example, ft_printf("%5d", 5); would result in '    5';

### [.precision]
Precision field specifies a maximum limit on the output.
For example, ft_printf("%.2s", "abcd"); would result in 'ab';

### [length]
Length specifiers tell what argument is expected. It will cause ft_printf() to typecast the input
to meet necessary requirement.

Allowed length specifiers 
```
'l' - For integer types, causes ft_printf to expect a long-sized integer argument.
'L' - For floating point types, causes ft_printf to expect a long double argument.
'hh' - For integer types, causes ft_printf to expect an int-sized integer argument which was promoted from a char.
'h' - For integer types, causes ft_printf to expect an int-sized integer argument which was promoted from a short.
'l' - For integer types, causes ft_printf to expect a long-sized integer argument.
'll' - For integer types, causes ft_printf to expect a long long-sized integer argument.
```

### type
Following conversion characters are allowed:

```
%c (character)
%s (string)
%p (address)
%d (digit)
%i (integer)
%o (digit in octal)
%u (unsigned integer)
%x (hexadecimal in lowercase)
%X (hexadecimal in upper case)
%f (float)
```
Furthermore, ft_printf supports multibyte characters. For multibyte character argument must have L in front of it indicating that it consists of wide characters. If multibyte character or string are printed, their respective conversion character has to be in capital. For example, to print 'â†’' character, %c becomes %C. If you wish, you can also print emojis.
```
ft_printf("%C", L'â†’'); Outputs 'â†’'.
ft_printf("%C", L'ðŸ˜Š'); Outputs 'ðŸ˜Š'

```
## Return value
Function returns bytes written to standard output. Thus, if multibyte character is printed, ft_printf() would return the amount of bytes it consists of not how many characters were printed.
